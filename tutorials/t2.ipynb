    "# Tutorial 2 - Hilbert spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilbert spaces are complete inner product spaces. Within all inverse problems considered we will assume that both the model and data space are Hilbert spaces. This is a restriction, but one that is difficult to avoid in practice. The data space in any real inverse problem is necessarily finite dimensional and so can always be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for some \n",
    "suitable $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In most cases of interest, however, the model space will be comprised of functions and be infinite-dimensional. Computationally we cannot deal directly with infinite-dimensional spaces, but we can ensure that we work with convergent discretisations. This means, roughly speaking, that the underlying mathematical problems are well-defined, and that the numerical methods can be shown to converge to the exact values as the size of the discretised model space is suitably increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we look into the representation of Hilbert spaces within the ```pygeoinf``` library through two examples. \n",
    "Hilbert spaces are represented by the ```HilbertSpace``` class. Importantly this class defines only the *structure* of the Hilbert space but its elements must be otherwise defined. To construct a class instance the user must provide the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dimension of the space. \n",
    "- A mapping from elements of the space to a chosen co-ordinate representation. \n",
    "- A mapping from this co-ordinate representation to elements of the space. \n",
    "- The inner product for the space. \n",
    "- A mapping from elements of the space to their associated dual vector.\n",
    "- A mapping from elements of the dual space into the their representation within the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of infinite-dimensional spaces, the dimension is understood as being that of an approximating space and the co-ordinate mappings describe projections and inclusions to and from this subspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euclidean space\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest Hilbert space is Euclidean space, and this is implemented in ```pygeoinf``` as the class ```EuclideanSpace``` that is derived from the ```HilbertSpace``` class. Constructuion of an instance of this class requires only its dimension. "
