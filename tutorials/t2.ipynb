    "# Tutorial 2 - Hilbert spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilbert spaces are complete inner product spaces. Within all inverse problems considered we will assume that both the model and data space are Hilbert spaces. This is a restriction, but one that is difficult to avoid in practice. The data space in any real inverse problem is necessarily finite dimensional and so can always be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for some \n",
    "suitable $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In most cases of interest, however, the model space will be infinite-dimensional. Computationally we cannot deal directly with infinite-dimensional spaces, but we can ensure that we work with convergent discretisations. This means, roughly speaking, that the underlying mathematical problem is well-defined, and that our numerical solutions can be shown to converge to this solution as the size of our discretised model space is suitably increased.\n",

    "Within this tutorial we look into the representation of Hilbert spaces within the ```pygeoinf``` library.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within ```pygeoinf```, Hilbert spaces are represented by the ```HilbertSpace``` class. This class defined only the *structure* of the Hilbert space but requires that the underlying elements have been otherwise defined. To define an instance of the ```HilbertSpace``` class the user must provide the following data:\n",

    "- The dimension of the space. \n",
    "- A mapping from element of the space to a chosen co-ordinate representation. \n",
    "- A mapping from this co-ordinate representation to elements of the space. \n",
    "- The inner product for the space. \n",
    "- A mapping from an element of the space to the associated dual vector, as provided by the Riesz representation theorem. \n",
    "- A mapping from an element of the dual space into the space, as provided by the Riesz representation theorem. \n",
