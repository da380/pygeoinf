    "# Tutorial 4 - Defining a custom ```HilbertSpace```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this tutorial we show through a simple but useful example how a user can define their own ```HilbertSpace```. A key point is that instances of ```HilbertSpace``` should not, in general, be constructed directly. Rather the intention is for the user to define a new class derived from ```HilbertSpace```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that ```pygeoinf``` has an implementation of Euclidean space. Here, we will generalise this to allow for a non-standard inner product. Elements of our space, $X$, will be vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, but we use the inner product\n",

    "$$\n",
    "with $M$ an symmetric and positive-definite matrix that we call the **metric**. From this definition, it follows that the Riesz mapping, $J_{X}$ on a component-level is just multiplication by $M$. \n",

The base class is then initialised, with implementations for the necessary mappings provided through private methods. As a general comment, these methods make use of properties derived from the base class. But there is no issue of circularity because these methods cannot be called until the base class has been constructed.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the only point at which this implementation of this space differs significantly from that for ```EuclideanSpace```. To map a vector to the dual space, we need to form its components, multiply by the metric, and then form the corresponding dual vector. In ```EuclideanSpace``` the metric is the identity and so the middle step is skipped. For the inverse mapping the process is analogous, but now we need to multiply by the inverse metric in the middle step. Within our implementation this is done efficiently using back-substitution having stored the Choelsky factorisation of the metric. "
