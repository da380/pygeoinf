    "### ```LinearOperators``` linked to a ```HilbertSpace```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ```HilbertSpace``` has methods that return a set of standard linear operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```coordinate_inclusion```: A property that returns $I_{X}$ as a ```LinearOperator``` from the appropriate ```EuclideanSpace``` into the space. \n",
    "- ```coordinate_projection```: A property that returns $P_{X}$ as a ```LinearOperator``` from the space into the appropriate ```EuclideanSpace```.\n",
    "- ```riesz```: A property that returns $J_{X}$ as a ```LinearOperator``` from the dual onto the space. \n",
    "- ```inverse_riesz```: A property that returns $J_{X}^{-1}$ as a ```LinearOperator``` from the space to its dual.\n",
    "- ```identity_operator```: A method that returns the identity operator on the space. \n",
    "- ```zero_operator```: A method that returns the zero operator on the space. Optinally, the codomain can be provided through the keyword argument, ````codomain```. \n",
    "\n",
    "The various ```HilbertSpaces``` that have been implemented within ```pygeoinf``` often have more specific linear operators pre-defined. For example, $H^{s}(\\mathbb{S}^{1})$ has ```point_evaluation_operator``` that maps an element to its values at a set of points. This method was used within Tutorial 1 to define the forward operator within the inverse problem considered. "
