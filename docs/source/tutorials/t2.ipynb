    "# Tutorial 2 - Hilbert spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilbert spaces are complete inner product spaces. Within all inverse problems considered we will assume that both the model and data space are Hilbert spaces. This is a restriction, but one that is difficult to avoid in practice. The data space in any real inverse problem is necessarily finite dimensional and so can always be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for some \n",
    "suitable $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In most cases of interest, however, the model space will be comprised of functions and be infinite-dimensional. Computationally we cannot deal directly with infinite-dimensional spaces, but we can ensure that we work with convergent discretisations. This means, roughly speaking, that the underlying mathematical problems are well-defined, and that the numerical methods can be shown to converge to the exact values as the size of the discretised model space is suitably increased. A principal aim of ```pygeoinf``` is to facilitate the implementation of such methods in the context of geophysical inverse problems. \n",

    "In this tutorial we look into the representation of Hilbert spaces within the ```pygeoinf``` library through two examples. \n",

    "- The dimension of the space. \n",
    "- A mapping from elements of the space to a chosen co-ordinate representation. \n",
    "- A mapping from this co-ordinate representation to elements of the space. \n",
    "- The inner product for the space. \n",
    "- A mapping from elements of the space to their associated dual vector.\n",
    "- A mapping from elements of the dual space into the their representation within the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of infinite-dimensional spaces, the dimension, $n$, is understood as being that of an approximating space that is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$  through the co-ordinate mappings provided. \n",
