    "The dual, $X'$, of a Hilbert space, $X$, is the set of all continuous linear functional on $E$. The Riesz representation theorem states that every Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic to its dual. This means that there is a continuous linear mapping,  $J_{X}\\in \\mathrm{Hom}(X',X)$, such that\n",

Within this tutorial we will look at the ```LinearForm``` class that is used to define dual vectors for a given ```HilbertSpace```. We will also see that each ```HilbertSpace``` can automatically generate its dual space. Each ```HilbertSpace``` also provides the mappings to and from its dual as defined through the Riesz representation theorem. \n",

But ```LinearForms``` cannot be constructed until the space is already set up. By, however, inheriting from ```HilbertSpace``` within a new class, we can insure that the space can be refered to in its methods, and that these methods cannot be called until the class has been set up. Below we see the implementation of ```EuclideanSpace``` from within the ```pygeoinf``` library. The ```to_component``` and ```from_component``` mappings are trivial, as noted above. Lastly, the mappings ```from_dual``` and ```to_dual``` are very simple, just reflecting the fact that the components of a dual vector and its representation are equal.

    "The implementation could be improved in various ways. We might, for example, allow the metric to be given in a more general form (e.g., as a ```scipy.sparse``` ```LinearOperator```) and its inverse computed using iterative methods. We might also allow the user to optionally provide the inverse metric directly. Such steps would be particularly useful if the dimension of the space is large. "
