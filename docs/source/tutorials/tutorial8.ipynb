    "# Tutorial 8: A Deeper Look at Bayesian Inversion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore the `LinearBayesianInversion` class in more detail. We will see how it combines information from a **prior** and a **likelihood** to produce a **posterior** distribution that represents our updated state of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bayesian Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Bayesian inversion is to compute the posterior probability distribution $p(u|d)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(u|d) = \\frac{p(d|u) p(u)}{p(d)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "* $p(u)$ is the **prior distribution**. This is a `GaussianMeasure` that encodes our knowledge about the model `u` *before* we see any data.\n",
    "* $p(d|u)$ is the **likelihood**. This is determined by the forward problem and our data error statistics. It tells us how likely it is to observe data `d` given a particular model `u`.\n",
    "* $p(u|d)$ is the **posterior distribution**. This is our updated `GaussianMeasure` for the model *after* observing the data. It combines the information from the prior and the likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is Bayesian Inversion \"Better\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inversion is not inherently \"better\" than optimization methods; it is a different tool with different goals. Its main advantage is that it provides a full quantification of uncertainty. However, the result is only as good as the information you put in. A reasonable, well-justified **prior** is essential. A poor or incorrect prior can bias the result and lead to misleading conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1.  Solve our circle inverse problem with a \"good\" prior.\n",
    "2.  Solve the same problem again with a deliberately \"wrong\" prior.\n",
    "3.  Compare the results to see the influence of the prior."

    "* The inversion with the **good prior** produces a posterior that is close to the true model where the data is sufficient, and otherwise leads to realistically large uncertainties. \n",
