    "# Tutorial 5: Solving Linear Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous tutorials, we've built `HilbertSpace`s and the `LinearOperator`s that act on them. Now, we'll focus on the final piece of the puzzle: solving linear systems. The `linear_solvers` module provides a unified interface for inverting `LinearOperator`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solver Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The solvers in this library are designed as callable classes. You first create an instance of a solver (e.g., `CholeskySolver`), and then you call that instance with the operator you want to invert. The result is a *new* `LinearOperator` that represents the inverse of the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A_inv = solver(A)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"functional\" approach is very flexible and fits well with the operator algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1.  Set up a simple linear system in `EuclideanSpace`.\n",
    "2.  Solve it using a **direct solver** (`CholeskySolver`).\n",
    "3.  Solve it again using an **iterative solver** (`CGSolver`).\n",
    "4.  Discuss when to choose each type of solver.\n",
    "5.  Demonstrate how **preconditioning** can accelerate iterative solvers."

    "## 5. Preconditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of iterative solvers can be dramatically improved with a **preconditioner**. A preconditioner is an operator `P` that is an approximation of the inverse of `A`. The solver then solves a modified, better-conditioned system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect preconditioner would be `P = A_inv`, but that's what we're trying to find! A good preconditioner is a cheap approximation of the inverse. The simplest choice is the **Jacobi preconditioner**, which is just the inverse of the diagonal of `A`."
