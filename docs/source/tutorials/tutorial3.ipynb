    "# Tutorial 3: Dual Spaces and Hilbert Space Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial, we saw how the `HilbertSpace` class provides a unified interface for different kinds of vector spaces. Now, we'll explore the theoretical engine that makes this possible: the concept of a **dual space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Theory in Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "For any `HilbertSpace`, $X$, its **dual space**, $X'$, is the space of all continuous linear maps from $X$ to the real numbers. We call these maps \"linear functionals\" or \"dual vectors.\" In this library, they are represented by the `LinearForm` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Riesz representation theorem** guarantees that for every dual vector $x' \\in X'$, there is a unique corresponding vector $x \\in X$. The map $J_X: X \\to X'$ that connects a vector to its dual representation is the **Riesz representation map**. This library uses a powerful design pattern where the inner product on $X$ is defined *implicitly* by this map and the natural **duality product** between the primal and dual spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle x, y \\rangle_X = \\langle J_X(x), y \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_X$ is the inner product on the primal space, and $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the duality product (the action of a `LinearForm` on a vector). In the library's syntax, this translates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "`space.inner_product(x, y) == space.duality_product(space.to_dual(x), y)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1.  Explore the `LinearForm` class.\n",
    "2.  Use the `dirac` functional as a concrete, non-trivial example of a `LinearForm` and its Riesz representation.\n",
    "3.  Recreate the `EuclideanSpace` class from scratch to demonstrate how the abstract `HilbertSpace` methods work.\n",
    "4.  Show how to create a non-standard inner product using `MassWeightedHilbertSpace`."
