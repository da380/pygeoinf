    "# Tutorial 4: Linear Operators, Duals, and Adjoints\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous tutorials, we introduced the `HilbertSpace` and the concept of a `dual` space. Now, we'll focus on the `LinearOperator` class, which defines linear maps between these spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Theory in Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a linear operator $A: X \\to Y$, we can define two related operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Dual Operator ($A'$)**: The dual (or transpose) operator maps between the dual spaces, $A': Y' \\to X'$. It is defined by the relation:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\langle y', A(x) \\rangle = \\langle A'(y'), x \\rangle\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    This relation holds for any $x \\in X$ and $y' \\in Y'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Adjoint Operator ($A^*$)**: The adjoint operator maps between the original primal spaces, but in reverse, $A^*: Y \\to X$. It is defined by the inner product:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\langle y, A(x) \\rangle_Y = \\langle A^*(y), x \\rangle_X\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of this library is that if you provide just the forward mapping for `A`, the library can automatically derive its `dual` and `adjoint` operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1.  Create a `LinearOperator` from a simple mapping.\n",
    "2.  Combine operators using standard arithmetic operations.\n",
    "3.  Numerically verify the defining relations for the dual and adjoint.\n",
    "4.  Create an operator on a `Sobolev` space using `from_formal_adjoint`."
