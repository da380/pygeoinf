Basis-Covariance Alignment in Sobolev Spaces: Design Principles

This document summarizes the key insights about aligning basis choice with
covariance operators for optimal Bayesian inversion performance.
"""

# =============================================================================
# MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

"""
The fundamental insight is that for computational efficiency and mathematical
clarity in Bayesian inversion, the basis choice should be aligned with the
covariance structure of the prior Gaussian measure.

Mathematically, if we have a Gaussian measure μ on a Hilbert space H with
covariance operator C, then:

1. The optimal basis {φₖ} consists of eigenfunctions of C:
   C φₖ = λₖ φₖ

2. In this basis, the covariance is diagonal:
   C = diag(λ₁, λ₂, λ₃, ...)

3. This leads to efficient sampling and computation:
   - Fast sampling via independent coefficients
   - Efficient matrix operations
   - Natural truncation based on eigenvalue decay

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES
# =============================================================================

"""
Our flexible Sobolev space design follows these principles:

1. USER-SPECIFIED BASIS:
   - User provides to_coefficient() and from_coefficient() functions
   - No assumptions about specific discretization or basis type
   - Full control over the mathematical structure

2. COVARIANCE ALIGNMENT:
   - User chooses basis that diagonalizes their covariance operator
   - Sobolev scaling function aligns with chosen basis
   - Optimal computational efficiency for specific applications

3. ABSTRACTION LEVEL:
   - Similar to base HilbertSpace class design
   - No built-in discretization assumptions
   - Maximum flexibility for custom applications

4. BAYESIAN INVERSION FOCUS:
   - Designed specifically for optimal performance in Bayesian inversion
   - Basis choice considers both prior and measurement operator
   - Enables efficient sampling and inference algorithms

# COMMON BASIS-COVARIANCE COMBINATIONS
# =============================================================================

"""
Here are common combinations that work well in practice:

1. FOURIER BASIS + DIFFERENTIAL OPERATOR PRIORS:
   - Basis: cos(kπx/L), sin(kπx/L)
   - Covariance: Derived from differential operators like -Δ + α²I
   - Best for: PDEs with periodic or Neumann boundary conditions
   - Example: Heat equation, wave equation with Neumann BC

2. SINE BASIS + DIRICHLET BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:
   - Basis: sin(kπx/L)
   - Covariance: From operators with zero boundary conditions
   - Best for: PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions
   - Example: Diffusion equation with u=0 on boundary

3. CHEBYSHEV BASIS + SMOOTH FUNCTION PRIORS:
   - Basis: Chebyshev polynomials Tₖ(x)
   - Covariance: Algebraic decay based on polynomial degree
   - Best for: Approximation of smooth functions
   - Example: Function reconstruction from scattered data

4. WAVELET BASIS + MULTISCALE PRIORS:
   - Basis: Wavelet functions ψⱼ,ₖ(x)
   - Covariance: Scale-dependent with local support
   - Best for: Functions with local features and discontinuities
   - Example: Signal processing, image reconstruction

5. EIGENFUNCTIONS OF PROBLEM-SPECIFIC OPERATORS:
   - Basis: Eigenfunctions of L† L where L is measurement operator
   - Covariance: Based on singular values of L
   - Best for: Optimal basis for specific inverse problems
   - Example: Computed tomography, seismic inversion

"""
When basis and covariance are properly aligned:

1. DIAGONAL COVARIANCE MATRIX:
   - Fast matrix operations: O(n) instead of O(n³)
   - Efficient storage: O(n) instead of O(n²)
   - Independent coefficient sampling

2. FAST TRANSFORMS:
   - Use FFT, DCT, DST for O(n log n) transforms
   - No need for expensive matrix factorizations
   - Real-time sampling and inference possible

3. NATURAL TRUNCATION:
   - Eigenvalue decay determines approximation error
   - Adaptive basis truncation based on desired accuracy
   - Optimal dimensionality reduction

4. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
   - Well-conditioned linear systems
   - No spurious oscillations from basis mismatch
   - Robust convergence of iterative methods

5. INTERPRETABILITY:
   - Coefficients have clear physical meaning
   - Easy to incorporate prior knowledge
   - Natural regularization through basis choice

# =============================================================================
# GUIDELINES FOR USERS
# =============================================================================

"""
To choose the optimal basis for your Bayesian inversion problem:

1. IDENTIFY YOUR PRIOR COVARIANCE:
   - What differential operator generates your prior?
   - What boundary conditions are natural for your problem?
   - What spatial/frequency characteristics does your prior have?

2. FIND THE EIGENBASIS:
   - Solve the eigenvalue problem for your covariance operator
   - Use known eigenbases for common operators (Fourier, etc.)
   - For custom operators, compute eigenfunctions numerically

3. IMPLEMENT THE BASIS:
   - Create to_coefficient() and from_coefficient() functions
   - Use fast transforms when available (FFT, DCT, etc.)
   - Ensure proper normalization and scaling

4. VERIFY ALIGNMENT:
   - Check that covariance is approximately diagonal in your basis
   - Monitor eigenvalue decay for truncation decisions
   - Test computational efficiency compared to alternatives

5. VALIDATE RESULTS:
   - Compare with known analytical solutions when available
   - Check convergence rates and approximation errors
   - Verify that samples from your Gaussian measure look reasonable
